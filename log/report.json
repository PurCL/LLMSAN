It is then used to create a File object at line 111, making the variable file sensitive. The file path is then used to open a FileInputStream at line 119, which is sensitive data. Hence, there is an Absolute Path Traversal bug at line 119.], [Trace: (Line 53, is_sensitive(data)), (Line 111, is_sensitive(file)), (Line 119, is_sensitive(streamFileInputSink))]\n---------------END REPORT----------------",
