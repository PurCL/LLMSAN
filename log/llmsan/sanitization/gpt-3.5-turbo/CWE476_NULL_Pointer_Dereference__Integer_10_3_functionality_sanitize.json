    "src response": "Step 1: Line 13 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition for line 13 is `if (IO.staticTrue)`. \n- Since `IO.staticTrue` is a static variable, its value is not changing during runtime.\n- If `IO.staticTrue` is true, then the block of code starting from line 4 will be executed, and `data` will be assigned a non-null value.\n- If `IO.staticTrue` is false, then the block of code starting from line 10 will be executed, and `data` will be assigned a null value.\n- Therefore, line 13 is reachable and can be executed with `data` being assigned a null value.\n\nYes",
