    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 5 contains a method access upon a Java object (data.toString()), which means there is a potential dereference of a null value.\n\nStep 2: There is no check to ensure that the variable data is not equal to null before invoking the toString() method. Hence, the variable data may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes.",
