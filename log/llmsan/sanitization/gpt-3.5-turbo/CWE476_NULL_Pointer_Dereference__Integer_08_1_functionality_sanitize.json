    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 3 is not an assignment from a null value directly. It is just a declaration of the Integer variable data without initialization.\n\n(Step 2) Let's examine the branch conditions:\n- In the if block starting at line 4, the condition privateReturnsTrue() is checked. If this condition is true, then line 7 assigns null to data. So, in this branch, data can be null.\n- In the else block starting at line 9, there is no assignment to data. So, data remains uninitialized in this branch.\n\nSince there is a path where data can be assigned null, we can conclude that data at line 3 can be null.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: Line 19 contains a method access upon a Java object (data.toString()), so we need to proceed to Step 2.\n\nStep 2: There is no check to ensure that data is not equal to null before invoking the toString() method on it. Therefore, data may have a null value and be dereferenced at line 19.\n\nYes",
