    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 12 is an assignment of null to the variable myString. Therefore, myString at line 12 can have a null value.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition at line 12 is `(privateFalse)`, which is a boolean variable. Since the condition is not dependent on the value of myString, the assignment of null to myString will always happen regardless of the branch condition. Hence, line 12 is reachable.\n\nYes",
