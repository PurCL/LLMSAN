    "src response": "Step 1: Line 8 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The while loop at line 5 is an infinite loop (while true), so it will always execute.\n- Inside the loop, at line 8, data is assigned null.\n- The break statement at line 9 will break out of the loop immediately after the assignment.\n- Therefore, the assignment at line 8 is reachable.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 21 contains a method access upon a Java object, which is IO.writeLine(\"data is null\").\n\nStep 2: The program line 21 does not check data and ensure it not to be equal to null. It directly uses the data variable without any null check.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes. \n\nYes",
