    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 7 is an assignment where `data` is assigned with `null`.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition of line 7 is `if (IO.staticTrue)`. Since the condition `IO.staticTrue` is a static variable, we cannot determine its value without additional context. However, if `IO.staticTrue` is true, then the assignment `data = null` at line 7 will be executed, making `data` null. If `IO.staticTrue` is false, then the assignment at line 13 will be executed, also making `data` null.\n\nTherefore, considering both branches, it is possible for `data` at line 7 to be null.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 21 contains a method access upon the Java object `data` as `data.length()`.\n\nStep 2: The program line 19 checks if `data` is not equal to null before accessing its length.
