Since myString is assigned null at line 7, the condition (myString != null) will evaluate to false, and the subsequent condition (myString.length() > 0) will not be evaluated due to short-circuiting behavior of the logical AND operator.\n\nTherefore, the line 7 assignment of null to myString is not reachable in this context.\n\nNo",
