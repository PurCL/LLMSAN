    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 12 is an assignment from a null value, as it assigns `null` to the variable `data`.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition of line 12 is `PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FIVE != 5`. Since the condition `PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FIVE==5` is checked in the if block at line 4, the else block at line 10 will always be executed when `PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FIVE` is not equal to 5. Therefore, the line 12 is reachable and can be executed.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 27 contains a method access upon the Java object data, as it calls the toString() method on the data object.\n\nStep 2: The program line 25 checks if the data object is not equal to null before accessing the toString() method on it. Therefore, the data object is ensured not to be null at this point.\n\nTherefore, the line 27 does not have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nNo",
