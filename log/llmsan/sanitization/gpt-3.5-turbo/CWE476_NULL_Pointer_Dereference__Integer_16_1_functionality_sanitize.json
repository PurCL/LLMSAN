    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 8 is an assignment where the variable `data` is assigned with `null`.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition of the while loop at line 5 is `true`, so the loop will always execute. Inside the loop, at line 8, `data` is assigned with `null`. Then, there is a `break` statement at line 9 which will exit the loop. Therefore, the line 8 is reachable and `data` can have a null value.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 15 contains a method access upon a Java object (data.toString()), which means it may dereference a null value.\n\nStep 2: There is no check to ensure that data is not equal to null before invoking the toString() method on it.\n\nTherefore, the line 15 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
