There are no conditions or branches that would prevent the assignment from taking place. The assignment `data = null;` is always executed.\n- Therefore, the line 6 is reachable and the variable `data` at line 6 can be null.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 6 contains a method access upon a Java object (data.length()).\n\nStep 2: The program line 6 does not check whether data is equal to null before invoking the length() method.\n\nTherefore, the line 6 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
