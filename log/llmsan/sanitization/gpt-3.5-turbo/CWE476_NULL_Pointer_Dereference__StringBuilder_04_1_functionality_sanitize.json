    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 3 is an assignment from a null value.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition at line 4 is PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_TRUE, which is not defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the branch condition. However, since the assignment of null to 'data' occurs within the if block, and there is no other assignment to 'data' outside of this block, we can conclude that 'data' can be null at line 3.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 19 contains a method access upon a Java object (data.length()).\n\nStep 2: The program line 19 does not check data and ensure it not to be equal to null. \n\nTherefore, the line 19 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
