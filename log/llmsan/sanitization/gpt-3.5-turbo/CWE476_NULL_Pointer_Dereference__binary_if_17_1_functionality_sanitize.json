Since myString is assigned with null at line 6, the condition (myString != null) will evaluate to false, and the second part of the condition will not be evaluated due to the short-circuit logical AND operator.\n\nTherefore, the assignment at line 6 is not reachable, and myString at line 6 cannot be null.\n\nNo",
