    "src response": "(Step 1) Yes, the line 11 is an assignment from a null value.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition at line 4 is `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE`, which is a static final variable. Since the value of this variable is not provided in the code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value at runtime. However, if `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE` evaluates to true, then the block of code starting from line 4 will be executed, leading to the assignment of `data` as null at line 7. Therefore, the line 11 is reachable and can be null.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 25 contains a method access upon a Java object, which is IO.writeLine(\"data is null\").\n\nStep 2: The program line 25 does not check data and ensure it not to be equal to null. \n\nTherefore, the line 25 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
