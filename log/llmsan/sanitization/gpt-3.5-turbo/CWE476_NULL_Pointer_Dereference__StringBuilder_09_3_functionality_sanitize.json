    "src response": "Step 1: Line 13 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition at line 4 is `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE`, which is a static final variable. \n- If `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE` is true, then the code inside the if block at line 5 to 8 will be executed, which assigns a new StringBuilder to `data`.\n- If `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE` is false, then the code inside the else block at line 9 to 14 will be executed, which assigns `null` to `data`.\n- Since the condition `IO.STATIC_FINAL_TRUE` is static and final, it does not change during runtime. Therefore, the line 13 is reachable and can be executed.\n\nYes",
