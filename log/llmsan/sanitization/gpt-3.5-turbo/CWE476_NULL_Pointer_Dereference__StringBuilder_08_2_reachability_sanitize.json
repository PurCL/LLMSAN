Both occurrences of data are referring to the same variable.\n\nStep 2: The value of data at line 3 is dependent on the condition at line 4. If `privateReturnsFalse()` returns true, data is set to null at line 8. If `privateReturnsFalse()` returns false, data is initialized as a new StringBuilder at line 14. \n\nSince the value of data is conditionally set based on the return values of `privateReturnsFalse()` and `privateReturnsTrue()`, we cannot definitively say that the value of data at line 3 and line 21 are the same without knowing the return values of these private methods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Not Sure.",
