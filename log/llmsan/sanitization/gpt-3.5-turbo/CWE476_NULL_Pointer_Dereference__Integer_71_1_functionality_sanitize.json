    "src response": "Step 1: Line 6 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition of line 6 is `data = null;`, which directly assigns the value null to the variable `data`.\n- There are no conditional statements or loops before line 6 that could change the assignment of null to `data`.\n- Therefore, the assignment of null to `data` at line 6 is always reached.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 8 contains a method access upon a Java object, which is the toString() method being invoked on the Integer object data.\n\nStep 2: The program line 8 does not check data and ensure it not to be equal to null. It directly passes the data object to the hooSink method without any null check.\n\nTherefore, the line 8 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
