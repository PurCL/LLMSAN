    "src response": "Step 1: Line 8 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition at line 8 is `data = null;`, which directly assigns the value null to the variable data.\n- There are no conditional statements or loops before line 8 that could prevent the assignment from happening.\n- Therefore, the assignment at line 8 is always reachable.\n\nYes",

Therefore, data may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
