    "src response": "Step 1: Line 13 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition for line 13 is `if (privateFive != 5)`, which means if `privateFive` is not equal to 5, then line 13 will be executed.\n- Since the condition is `privateFive==5` in the subsequent code, the else block at line 13 will be executed, assigning `data` to null.\n\nTherefore, data at line 13 can be null.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 19 contains a method access upon the Java object data, as data.length() is being called.\n\nStep 2: The program does not check data and ensure it is not equal to null at line 19.\n\nTherefore, the variable data at line 19 may have a null value and be dereferenced.\n\nYes",
