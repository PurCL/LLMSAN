    "src response": "(Step 1) Line 13 is an assignment from a null value.\n\n(Step 2) The branch condition for line 13 is \"privateFive != 5\". Since the condition \"privateFive == 5\" is checked before line 13, the else block at line 13 will only be executed if \"privateFive != 5\" is true. Therefore, line 13 is reachable.\n\nYes",
    "sink response": "Step 1: The program line 19 contains a method access upon the Java object data, as data.length() is being called.\n\nStep 2: The program does not check data and ensure it is not equal to null at the program line 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Yes. \n\nYes",
