    "src response": "Step 1: Line 8 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: Branch condition at line 4 is \"if (privateFive!=5)\". Since the condition is not related to the variable 'data', we can skip this branch.\n\nStep 3: Line 8 is inside the else block of the condition at line 4. The condition at line 4 is \"if (privateFive!=5)\", so when privateFive is equal to 5, the else block is executed.\n\nTherefore, the line 8 is reachable and 'data' can be null.\n\nYes",
