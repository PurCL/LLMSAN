    "src response": "Step 1: Line 8 is an assignment from a null value.\n\nStep 2: \n- The branch condition at line 4 is `if (privateFive!=5)`. \n- If `privateFive` is not equal to 5, the code inside the if block at line 5 to line 9 will be executed.\n- Line 8 assigns `data` to null inside the if block.\n- Since the condition `privateFive!=5` is used to determine the assignment of null to `data`, it is reachable.\n- Therefore, data at line 8 can be null.\n\nYes",
